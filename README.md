A comprehensive image viewer written using the core EFL.

This is a current development version, changes to be offered for acceptance
upstream, mostly seeking to address annoyances and some bugs, rather than
feature enhancement; that may come later. This is mostly intended to further
ephoto and give it new life in the EFL app community.
